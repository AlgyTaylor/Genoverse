Genoverse is a portable, customizable, back-end independent JavaScript and HTML5 based genome browser which allows the user to explore data in a dynamic and interactive manner.

Data is visualized in the browser, meaning Genoverse can be installed on any website and show data from a wide range of online or local sources.

Genoverse works with a variety of formats, such as XML, JSON or delimited text files, and can be customized to parse and display any data source as required.

The example above shows a region of mouse chromosome 8, with sequence, variation and gene data from Ensembl using the GRCm38 assembly, and addition gene data from the NCBIm37 assembly via a DAS source.

More information coming soon. If you have any questions, please contact info@genoverse.org
